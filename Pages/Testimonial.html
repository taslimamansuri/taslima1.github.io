<p>Testimonials straight from the hearts of our clients</p>

<h3>A DREAM COME TRUE...</h3><br>
<p id="testimonial">"A wedding is a day that most girls dream about from the time they are young. For me it was a day that I wanted everything to be perfect. Being a perfectionist I had a really hard time letting others take care of some wedding tasks. However, when I knew Melissa would be responsible for our flowers and decor, I had no worries. I knew that with her amazing talent, everything would be absolutely beautiful and just right. Melissa was very supportive, thoughtful, organized and always had such fresh and creative ideas. On our wedding day, Melissa pulled everything together and every single detail was elegant and gorgeous. Our wedding day would not have been the same without her!"
